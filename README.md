# Readme

Test runner that caches your database connection or any of your expensive computation between tests runs.

Since you can use jest's expect library, i.e, [expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect). The tests remains same and should work with the change of `connectToDb` function to fix the database connection.

## Motivation

Jest's test runner has no capability to share values and module between tests suites in watch mode. Issue [closed here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6800). But it seems that work is going on this [issue here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7184).

## Features

- Watch mode + Hot-reloading of server
- No need to stop and restart server when you update `config.fr.js` file
- Generate config file via: `npx flash-runner gen` or `npx flash-runner generate` from command line

## Usage

### Cli

```bash
# Installation
npm i flash-runner

# Add below scripts to `package.json` and utilise those script
"scripts": {
	"test": "fr test1.test.js",
	"test-watch": "fr -w test1.test.js"
},
# -w is alias for --watch
```

### Sample test:

```js
// file: test1.test.js
const { expect } = require("expect");
const { test } = global;

// Connect to db if you want
// connectToDb(async () => { })

const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

test("sum function", async () => {
  const received = sum(1, 2);
  const expected = 3;

  expect(received).toBe(expected);
});
```

NOTE: `connectToDb` is intended to make a cache of database connection as you can see the way I have used in many reference projects section.

Running tests:

- watch mode: `npm run test-watch`
- run it once (for ci-cd build test pipeline): `npm test`

### Beginners with testing? Some commonly used assertions

```js
// All below expectation will be PASSED
expect(10).toBe(10);
expect({ name: "dan", age: "22" }).toHaveProperty("name");
expect({ name: "roy", age: 10 }).toMatchObject({ name: "roy" });
expect([1, 21, 31]).toContain(1, 21);
```

## Other notes:

- FYI: Always use `express-async-errors` while testing a express app coz it will helps directly to `flash-runner` and standalone `server` running in prevention of crashing (in case of some error thrown). This is helpful in `flash-runner` as the server doesn't crash on failure/exception thrown by one route and thus watching service keeps running as well. Yikes! `Flash-runner`+`express-async-errors` rocks!

**Todo**

- Implement `test.skip` functionality like jest.

**Develop without publishing to npm**

```bash
# In this directory
npm i
npm link

# In target directory where you want to use flash-runner
npm link flash-runner
```
